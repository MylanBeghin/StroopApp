## 📖 About

**StroopApp** is an open-source Windows desktop application designed to administer Stroop tasks in experimental research contexts, including psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and related fields.

It implements a **visual cues task-switching paradigm** inspired by Mangin et al. (2021, 2022), with a strong focus on experimental rigor, timing precision, and reproducibility.  
The application is designed to be **no-code**, allowing researchers to configure and run experiments without technical setup.

### 🎯 Key features

- Flexible experimental configuration (congruency ratio, number of trials, task-switching rate)
- Visual cues paradigm using shapes (circle = name color, square = read word)
- Millisecond-level reaction time measurement
- Automatic export of detailed results (Excel, trial-by-trial)
- Multilingual interface (English and French)
- Dual-window architecture (experimenter dashboard + participant full-screen view)
- Ready-to-use for research without writing code

### 🎓 Who should use StroopApp?

- PhD students and postdoctoral researchers studying the Stroop effect
- Psychology laboratories investigating cognitive control and interference
- Neuroscience research teams working on task-switching paradigms
- Educators demonstrating the Stroop effect in teaching contexts

## 🎬 Demo

Below is a short demonstration of **StroopApp** highlighting the experimenter-side interface and workflow.

**Experiment configuration**  
This screen allows the experimenter to define all experimental parameters, including congruency ratio, number of trials, task-switching rate, language, and export settings, through a no-code graphical interface.

**Experiment monitoring (experimenter view)**  
This window provides real-time monitoring of the running experiment, including current trial status and progression, allowing the experimenter to supervise the session without interfering with the participant’s task.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Installation

1. Download the latest **StroopApp.exe** from the [Releases](https://github.com/MylanBeghin/StroopApp/releases) page
2. Launch the executable

StroopApp is distributed as a **self-contained Windows executable**.  
No installation steps, no dependencies, and no .NET runtime are required.

### Basic workflow

```text
1. Launch StroopApp
2. Select the interface language (English or French)
3. Configure the experimental profile (task parameters, trial structure)
4. Select the export directory for experimental results*
5. Verify key mappings used for participant responses
6. Create and select the participant associated with the session
7. Start the experiment
8. Set up the participant window (multi-screen setup)**
9. Monitor experiment progress from the experimenter interface
```
*By default, results are saved in the user’s **Documents** folder.
It is strongly recommended to explicitly select an export directory to ensure that results are stored in a known and easily retrievable location.

**During the experiment, the participant view is displayed in fullscreen **without window borders**, as required for experimental control.
In multi-screen setups, the experimenter must manually position the participant window on the appropriate display before starting the task.

Two methods are available:

* Manual positioning using the mouse
* Windows keyboard shortcuts

Detailed instructions are available in the documentation:
[Participant window setup](https://github.com/MylanBeghin/StroopApp/wiki/Usage#7-participant-window-setup)

### System requirements

* **OS**: Windows 7 or newer (tested on Windows 7, 10, and 11)
* **RAM**: 1 GB recommended
* **Display**: 1280×720 minimum (1920×1080 recommended for dual-screen setups)
* **Storage**: 200 MB available

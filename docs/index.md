# StroopApp Documentation

Welcome to the StroopApp documentation. This guide will help you get started with using StroopApp for your Stroop task experiments.

## Overview

StroopApp is a modern Windows desktop application for administering Stroop tasks in experimental psychology research. It implements visual cue paradigms based on the methodology described in Mangin et al. (2021, 2022).
